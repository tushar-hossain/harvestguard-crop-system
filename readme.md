# üåø HarvestGuard Crop System

A machine learning‚Äìpowered crop disease detection system built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in **Python**. The project was developed as a **final year thesis** at Sonargaon University and runs on **localhost** due to the large dataset size (2GB+). It analyzes leaf images to detect plant diseases and suggests proper treatment.

## üìå Project Overview

HarvestGuard allows users to:

- Upload a photo of a plant leaf
- Use a trained CNN model to classify the disease
- Display recommended treatment on a web interface
- Run locally without a database

This is an academic project focused on practical machine learning and deep learning application.

## üß† Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **TensorFlow 2.16.1**
- **Keras 3.5.0**
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **OpenCV**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions (Anaconda)

Follow these steps to set up and run the project in a clean Anaconda environment:

```bash
# 1. Create a new conda environment with Python 3.12.4
conda create --name tensorflow python=3.12.4

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate tensorflow

# 3. Upgrade pip
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

# 4. Install TensorFlow 2.16.1
pip install tensorflow==2.16.1

# 5. Install GPU support (optional)
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0

# 6. Install Keras
pip install keras==3.5.0

# 7. Install Jupyter Notebook
conda install anaconda::jupyter

# 8. Fix charset-normalizer error (if it occurs)
conda install -c conda-forge charset-normalizer

# 9. Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

```
